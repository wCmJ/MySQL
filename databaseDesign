Bad database design is sure to cause regrets down the road.

1. Design questions:
        what are the business requirements?
        what tables will I need to fulfill those requirements?
        what columns will each table contain?
        How will the tables be normalized?
        What will their parent/child relationships be?
        requirements    ->      tables      ->      columns     ->      tables normalized       ->      tables relationships
2. Data questions
        How much?
        Who/What?
        Where come from?
        Processes automaticlly?
        
For centralized databases, security factors should be considered.
   Security questions
        Who should have access to this database?
        Who should have access to which tables? Read-only access? Write access?
        Is this database critical to business operations?
